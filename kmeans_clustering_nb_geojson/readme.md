This Jupyter Notebook performs K-Means clustering on world population data (2015–2022) and visualizes the results on a world map using GeoPandas and Contextily.
The goal is to identify countries with similar population magnitudes and growth patterns, helping to understand global demographic distribution and trends.

Required Pacakges - 
geopandas  
pandas  
matplotlib  
scikit-learn  
contextily  
shapely  
fiona

How to Run - 
1. Open the notebook (Geospatial_kmeans_clustering.ipynb) in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially — the data will be downloaded automatically.
3. Check the generated world maps for each year (with/without basemap).
4. The output files (.gpkg and .geojson) will be saved for further use or mapping.
